Scripts for indexing a Danbooru image database using iqdb.

These scripts are very specific and you'll probably have to customize them
heavily to suit your purposes. They assume a 3-level directory structure of 16
subdirectories each to hold the MD5-based preview files. You can use make_dirs
to create this structure.

danbooru-refresh
	Script designed to be run from cron to periodically remove old images
	and download and index new ones, then restart the iqdb server.

	Adjust the directory and DB names, and the HTTP proxy line.

danbooru-change
	Called by the above to download previews for new posts, and to check
	deleted posts once a day. Also stores post data in a mysql database.

	Adjust the directory names, and create the appropriate tag cfg files,
	which should hold the login and password hash as described in the
	Danbooru API docs:
		$user="foobar";
		$pw='1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd';
		$host="danbooru.donmai.us";

mkdup:
	A script that builds and maintains an IQDB database along with a DB
	of filenames it contains. It uses iqdb's dupe finder function to
	generate a list of similar images. See its comment for more info.

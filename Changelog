iqdb-20130824:
- fix include files for newer gcc
- updated scripts

iqdb-20091112:
- add "sim" command to server mode
- various improvements in danbooru-change script

iqdb-20090612:
- add imgseek mode to dupe finder script that searches for a
  given image file in the dupe database
- fix wrong transparent png background color
- add int size and endianness check
- some minor fixes to allow it to compile on Debian Lenny
- add platform-independent 64bit DB file mode and make it the default
- auto-convert on load if int sizes don't match, see README
  for details on how to do a permanent conversion to 64bit mode
- allow querying by image data literal (instead of filename)
- allow limiting iqdb queries to a few IP addresses using
  -s <IP/hostname> (can be given multiple times)
- allow to return only relevant results that exceed a minimum
  standard deviation, set using "queryopt mindev <min.std.dev.>"
- report number of results that follow for every query, using
  a "101 matches=<number>" reply
- allow setting debug level at start with -d and while running
  with the "debuglevel <level>" command

iqdb-20081123:
- make it compile with g++ 4.3.x
- add maintenance commands to list, load, save and drop databases
  without restarting the server
- listen mode can now listen on two sockets, only one of which
  supports maintenance commands, and whose pending requests will
  be serviced before those on the other (low priority) socket
- make it compile on *BSD (missing include)
- fix crash in delta_queue (ungodly memory consumption)
  on 64bit platforms

iqdb-20080718:
- support GD for image loading and resizing
  (it's the default now, edit the Makefile if you prefer ImageMagick)
- special code for efficiently resizing high-res JPEG and PNG images
  if using GD
- fixed dupe finder, call iqdb find_duplicated <dbfile> [<std.dev threshold>]
- added mkdup script to maintain filename and iqdb database and
  generate lists of files with duplicate images
- allow using custom routines for microtime_float, thumb_fname, make_thumb
  and request_srv in the PHP code, if you need to do things a little, but
  not completely, differently
- added sample code showing how to use CurlTransfer for URL
  transfers with status updates

iqdb-20080612:
- optimized delta_iterator to improve query speed by ~20%
  (now as fast or even slightly faster than before)

iqdb-20080611:
- greatly reduced memory usage (and only slightly increased query
  times) with USE_DELTA_QUEUE in the Makefile (enabled by default)
- support for returning only results matching an AND/XOR bit mask
  set the mask with the command "query_opt mask <and> <xor>"
  (mask stored internally instead of the image width)
- the rehash command in "alter" mode (e.g. when run as
  "iqdb command ...") will update bucket sizes if they are out of
  sync, to reduce memory usage
- added PHP CurlTransfer class which implements the HTTP transfer
  with regular status updates on slow or stalled transfers
- fixed a bug that caused it to ignore width and height set
  while adding an image, as opposed to with "set_res" later
- several internal code cleanups and optimizations

iqdb-20080417:
- load data needed for queries into memory in readonly/simple mode
  (can be disabled by editing the Makefile configuration)
- removed support for multiple DBs in one file
- added support for direct manipulation of file (adding/removing pics)
  for faster updates
- added support for add/remove in simple/readonly mode as well, though
  these modifications can obviously not be saved and so need to be
  done both in memory and the DB file
- the "command" and "add" options now use the new alter mode, hence
  queries are not supported (along with some other info commands)
- corrupt database data now causes iqdb to abort with exit code 10.
  this indicates that restarting it is useless until the DB is fixed.

iqdb-20080303:
- preliminary find_duplicates function
- refactored web interface into frontend and XML backend

iqdb-20080218:
- first published version
